Query Parameters
​
inputMint
stringrequired
Base58-encoded input mint address

​
outputMint
stringrequired
Base58-encoded output mint address

​
amount
integerrequired
Input amount as a scaled integer. For example, 1 SOL is 1000000000.

Required range: x >= 0
​
slippageBps

integer
Max allowed slippage for the swap. Allowed values are:

a u16 which specifies the maximum allowed slippage in basis points
the string value "auto", where the server determines the maximum allowed slippage automatically Slippage tolerance specified in basis points
Required range: x >= 0
​
dexes
string
Comma-separated list of DEXes to include. If not specified, all DEXes will be included.

​
excludeDexes
string
Comma-separated list of DEXes to exclude. If not specified, all DEXes will be included.

​
platformFeeBps
integer
Optional platform fee in basis points. This should only be nonzero if the swap will collect
the platform fee. The swap must specify a valid fee account and that fee account must be
able to collect the fee mint at execution time.

Required range: x >= 0
​
platformFeeMode
enum<string>
Optional platform fee mode. If not specified, the default is outputMint.

Available options: outputMint, inputMint 
​
sponsoredSwap
boolean
This should be specified as true if and only if the quote will be used for a sponsored swap.
If true, then the quote will account for any additional token 2022 transfer fees that apply
to the input and output mints for a sponsored swap.

​
destinationSwap
boolean
This should be specified as true if and only if the quote will be used for a destination
token account swap. If true, then the quote will account for any additional token 2022
transfer fees that apply to the output mint for a destination token account swap.

​
onlyDirectRoutes
boolean
If true, only use single-leg routes

​
maxRouteLength
integer
If specified, the route will be limited to the specified number of legs. Ignored if
only_direct_routes is true.

Required range: x >= 0
